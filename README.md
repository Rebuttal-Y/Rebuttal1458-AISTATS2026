# Rebuttal1458-AISTATS2026
This repository is to share codes and training reports as the reviewer requirement.

All records including hyperparameters, training progress and test results are contained in the *.ini files under folder result_paper in each PDE folder. The results are arranged based on the table sequence in the paper.

To run code, just run the bash files under every PDE folder directly.

To replicate the test results, you need to extract the hyperparameters from *.ini file and insert them to the related bash.

The environment needs Jax, tensorly, optax, numpy and other necessary libs. Pls install them as needed.
